# Frontend Mentor - GitHub User Search App Solution

This is my solution to the [GitHub User Search App Challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/github-user-search-app-Q09YOgaH6). This challenge helped me enhance my skills in React, Next.js, and API integration by building a real-world application.

## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- View an optimal layout for the app based on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements
- Search for GitHub users by their username
- Display relevant user information fetched from the GitHub API
- Switch between light and dark themes
- **Bonus:** Automatically adapt the color scheme based on the system preferences using `prefers-color-scheme` in CSS

## My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox & CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JavaScript library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest)

### What I Learned

During this project, I improved my knowledge of fetching and displaying data from an external API using Next.js. Implementing dynamic theme switching based on system preferences was another key learning aspect.

Hereâ€™s an example of handling API requests:

```js
const fetchGitHubUser = async (username) => {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(`https://api.github.com/users/${username}`);
    if (!response.ok) throw new Error('User not found');
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error);
  }
};
```

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I want to:

- Improve error handling for better user experience
- Implement caching to reduce redundant API requests
- Explore integrating TypeScript for better type safety
- Add unit and integration tests

### Useful Resources

- [GitHub API Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/rest) - Helped with understanding API structure
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Used for quick styling and responsiveness
- [Next.js Image Optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/image-optimization) - Helped with handling external images
